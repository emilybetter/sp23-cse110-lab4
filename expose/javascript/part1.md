1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. the code returns an error because "result" is declared with the 'let' keyword in the if block, and line 13 is outside the block but is still trying to access the variable, which returns an error
5. the code returns an error because result is defined with the const keyword on line 5, but line 7 is trying to reassign the value which you can't do with a const so you get an error
6. the code returns an error because the program trys to reassign the value of a const variable, as well as an error from trying to access a variable outside the scope (result is defined in the if block and line 13 is outside the if block)
